## Prerequisites
This plugin uses glyphs from a patched NERDfont. So in order for this plugin to work you need to
install a NERDfont and set it as the default font for your terminal.

This plugin is inspired by Alexander Jeurissen's ranger_devicons which can be found here:
https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons

## Installation instructions
Append the SETUP file to your ~/.config/vifm/vifmrc file and restart Vifm to take affect. 
Uninstallation is done the same way but instead by removing the appended lines.
